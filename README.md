# Folder to help practice CSS.

### When I started learning how to code I wanted to have a folder where I could make small practice projects to test and practice different CSS concepts. Some projects are projects I made by myself, some are from the FreeCodeCamp course I did, and some are when I tried to recreate the FreeCodeCamp course without any help.
