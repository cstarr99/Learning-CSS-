          The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football
          league composed of 32 teams, divided equally between the American
          Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC).
          The NFL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United
          States and Canada and the highest professional level of American
          football in the world.[5] Each NFL season begins annually with a
          three-week preseason in August, followed by the 18-week regular
          season, which runs from early September to early January, with each
          team playing 17 games and having one bye week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each
          conference, including the four division winners and three wild card
          teams, advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament, which
          culminates in the Super Bowl, played in early February between the
          winners of the AFC and NFC championship games. The NFL is
          headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.

        <p>
          Gameplay in American football consists of a series of downs,
          individual plays of short duration, outside of which the ball is or is
          not in play. These can be plays from the line of scrimmage passes,
          runs, punts or field goal attempts (from either a place kick or a drop
          kick) or free kicks such as kickoffs and fair catch kicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal
          of specialization as coaches choose the players best suited for each
          particular situation for offense, defense, and also special teams.
          During a play, each team should have a maximum of 11 players on the
          field, and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific
          play.

        <p>
          Divisions are also, of course, used to set up playoff matchups near
          the end of the season. If you win your division, you get an automatic
          trip to the playoffs, and that accounts for eight of the 14 teams
          competing in the playoffs every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the divisional play is used like this, it encourages fierce
          competitions among the different regions, and of course just makes it
          easier to schedule the playoff rounds.

          The National Football League (NFL) playoffs is the annual
          single-elimination tournament held to determine the league champion.
          The four-round tournament is held after the league's regular season.
          Since the 2020 season, seven teams from each of the league's two
          conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season winning
          percentage, with a tie-breaking procedure if required. The top team in
          each conference receives a first-round bye, automatically advancing to
          the next round.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tournament culminates in the Super Bowl, the league's championship
          game, competed between teams from each conference. Among the four
          major professional sports leagues in the United States, the NFL
          postseason is the only one to use a single-elimination tournament in
          all of its rounds.

            <p>
              Every year thousands of players in the US collegiate system become
              eligible for the draft but the total number of selections is
              limited to about 250.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Although players who go undrafted can still be signed later, most
              future stars are picked up during the three-day event.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              But early draft picks can often flop in the NFL while some chosen
              late become greats - Tom Brady was selected 199th overall in 2000
              yet went on to win a record seven Super Bowls.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The draft is divided into seven rounds - the first taking place on
              a Thursday, rounds two and three on Friday and four to seven on
              Saturday.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              All 32 teams have one pick in each round, going in the reverse
              order of the previous season's standings - so the team with the
              worst record goes first and the Super Bowl winners last - but
              previous trades mean that is not strictly the case.
